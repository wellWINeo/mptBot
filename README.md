<h5 align="center"> Simple Python-written telegram bot for <a href="https://mpt.ru">MPT</a></h5>


# Installation

Bot has some several dependencies:
    
    * Python3 (min tested version - 3.7)
    
    * pip3
    
    * make (can be skipped)
    
    * All python-deps listed in `requirements.txt`

To install python-deps use `make setup`, it will install all modules via pip and create some files for bot's purpose. You can do it manually, if don't wanna use make.
